# AirPods Toggle Script
i create this script to be able to connect or disconnect airpods via keybind.

also other way i find myself using it is by setting it as an bash alias.

## Usage
either edit the script and set the variable AIRPODS_NAME to match your airpods name. other option is to just provide your airpods name as an argument.
